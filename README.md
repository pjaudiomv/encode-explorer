Encode Explorer
==================================

Encode Explorer is a file browser written in PHP, XHTML and CSS. It displays 
the list of files in a folder. It was designed to be used in safe mode and so 
it is kept simple and functional. Free for everyone.

* Files can be sorted by name, size and editing time
* You can move in folders
* Thumbnails for images and pdf files.
* File uploading (needs PHP full mode)
* Logging and notifications
* Optional password protection
* Interface for mobile devices


Looking for a new manager
----------------------------------
Updated 5 March 2018: I am currently busy with other projects and therefore unable to continue updating encode explorer. Since the project is still quite popular, I am looking for someone to take over the maintenance and development of this code. This person should be someone with an established github history of contributing to open-source PHP projects. If you are interested, contact me at marek.rei@gmail.com.


Manual
----------------------------------
You have to upload index.php into your server.
If you open index.php you can edit several settings.
You should make sure the edited file will be saved in UTF-8!
